# python_featurize_elements
Python module to generate chemistry representations of the elements. 

Features borrowed from Magpie library which is Java based (https://bitbucket.org/wolverton/magpie/src). 

Clone the repository and you can access 65 different chemical properties for elements with atomic numbers up to 103. Aim is to enable researchers doing material informatics get easy access to elemental descriptors. 

Will add more databases for properties with time.
